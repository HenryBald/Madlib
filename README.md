## How It Works:
In this program, we allow you to input words that follow our instructions to create a variety of different stories, including sci-fi, horror, comedy, and mystery.

## Our Approach:
Our team was excited to begin work on this project. We decided to split up and work on different parts of the program, while maintaining communication throughout the process such as a two people building the actual stories, two coding the user input and lastly the last 2 working on storing user input into arrays and whenever a group finished before the other they helped making adjustments. The approach we took was to put it all in one class instead of breaking it up since it was found to be complicated for our team. Then we quickly decided to maake seperate methods that store user input for things such as nouns, adjectives, verbs, color, etc to avoid repeated code.

## Challenges We Faced:
We encountered some difficulties using classes, so we made the decision to avoid them. However, this turned out to be a good choice as we found alternative solutions while brainstorming ideas within the group. Additionally, we faced challenges communicating the correct prompts to the user for input at the right time. This is because in some spots it did not make sense to ask a user input leading it to be tricky to find the correct spot in a story that would make sense if it was chnaged. Another issue that was faced was placing the user input into and array and calling it when needed. This was really hard to do but using the help in the java documentation in codeHS we learned that there is a .get() method which helped us grab the arrays and the specific one needed. But even doing this it worked for the first story but once user wanted to make another story it got wierd and we were really confused but then we found out that we forgot to clear the array list and using once again the java documentation we used to .clear() method and used it for all our array lists and placed it into an if statement.
