# Madlib Java Project

## How it works
In this program we will allow you to input words that follow our intructions to make a funny story, and if you don't find it funny then you should never do anything with computer programming again.

## Our approach
Our team was extremely exited to begin work on this project, and we quickly decided to split up and work on different parts of the program, while still communicating throughout the process.

## Challenges we faced
We had some though times using classes so we made the desion to not use classes, although it worked out in the end and we found other solutions while throwing out some different ideas between the group.

## Our Code
