## How It Works:
In this program, we allow you to input words that follow our instructions to create a variety of different stories, including sci-fi, horror, comedy, and mystery. Also this is a command line program that has 15 user inputs per story.

## Our Approach:
Our team was excited to begin work on this project. We decided to split up and work on different parts of the program, while maintaining communication throughout the process. The approach we took was to put it all in one class instead of breaking it up since it was found to be complicated for our team. Then we quickly decided to maake seperate methods that store user input for things such as nouns, adjectives, verbs, color, etc to avoid repeated code.

## Challenges We Faced:
* The main challenge we faced was that CodeHS, when tons of people were on it, sometimes just moved us to different lines of code we weren't typing on, and accidentally deleting things and stuff. It took a lot of frustration, taking some DEEEEEP breaths, and reloading and saving the code a bunch, but eventually we got used to it and were able to make progress.

* We encountered some difficulties using classes, so we made the decision to avoid them. However, this turned out to be a good choice as we found alternative solutions while brainstorming ideas within the group.

* Additionally, we faced challenges communicating the correct prompts to the user for input at the right time. This is because in some spots it did not make sense to ask a user input leading it to be tricky to find the correct spot in a story that would make sense if it was changed.
