## How It Works: // no need we not in requirements swap with features.
In this program, we allow you to input words that follow our instructions to create a variety of different stories, including sci-fi, horror, comedy, and mystery.

## Our Approach:
Our team was excited to begin work on this project. We decided to split up and work on different parts of the program, while maintaining communication throughout the process such as a two people building the actual stories, two coding the user input and lastly the last 2 working on storing user input into arrays and whever a group finished beore the other they helped making adjustments. The approach we took was to put it all in one class instead of breaking it up since it was found to be complicated for our team. Then we quickly decided to maake seperate methods that store user input for things such as nouns, adjectives, verbs, color, etc.

## Challenges We Faced:
We encountered some difficulties using classes, so we made the decision to avoid them. However, this turned out to be a good choice as we found alternative solutions while brainstorming ideas within the group. Additionally, we faced challenges communicating the correct prompts to the user for input at the right time. 
// this isnt even a issue bruh
