## How It Works:
In this program, we allow you to input words that follow our instructions to create a variety of different stories, including sci-fi, horror, comedy, and mystery.

## Our Approach:
Our team was extremely excited to begin work on this project. We quickly decided to split up and work on different parts of the program, while maintaining communication throughout the process. 

## Challenges We Faced:
We encountered some difficulties using classes, so we made the decision to avoid them. However, this turned out to be a good choice as we found alternative solutions while brainstorming ideas within the group. Additionally, we faced challenges communicating the correct prompts to the user for input at the right time.
