In the vast land of the PLACE, where the wind sang songs and the birds VERB, a young superhero named NAME stood at the end of a PHYSICAL THING, gazing at the moon. Her cape whipped in the wind as she traced the priceless THING in her hand, knowing stealing it was the worst decision she’d ever made. She turned and headed to the hidden BUILDING TYPE to make the final transfer, where she would finally have all she needed to leave her dark past behind. Just as she was about to drop the PRICELESS THING, a loud noise startled her. Turning around, she found her only happy memory from the past,a LARGE THING, smashed on the ground. Tears filled her eyes as she realized who would dare do this: her father, NAME, the man who’d never been there when she needed him. "I knew you'd come back," he said coldly.
Enraged, NAME(ORIGANAL SUPERHERO'S NAME) called her friend NAME, telling her it was time to take away what he loved most: his CAR TYPE. The plan was to smash it into a large LARGE THING(SAME)  and cover it with rotten FOOD. That night, she snuck into his house, grabbed the car keys, and drove the CAR TYPE to the fence. As she crashed it into the LARGE THING(SAME), she could only imagine her father’s reaction when he discovered what she had done.
