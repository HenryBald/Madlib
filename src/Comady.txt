In DATE, the Titanic, a massive THING  built to be "unsinkable," set sail on its ADJECTIVE voyage. Everyone on board was feeling pretty EMOTION about their trip—after all, what could go wrong on a ship that was basically the equivalent of a floating luxury THING? But then, on the night of MONTH DATE, disaster struck. The Titanic hit an OCEAN THING, and within a few hours, it was at the bottom of the ocean. The whole thing was probably a little like a bad reality show: "Watch as this ADJECTIVE ship, which everyone thought was invincible, sinks in front of an audience of rich THING trying to get to PLACE." If only they’d had a "Titanic for SILLY THING" guide, maybe they would’ve known that, you know, avoiding icebergs is kind of important.
As the ship went down, there were reportedly a lot of people who were more concerned with finding their PRICELESS THING than actually getting into lifeboats. The rich passengers were reportedly screaming about their PLURAL THING while the crew was scrambling to lower the lifeboats—like a weird version of “TV SHOW,” where the people who were supposed to survive were too busy packing their fancy clothes. In the end, the Titanic’s "unsinkable" reputation sank SPEED TYPE than the ship itself, and it became a cautionary tale for anyone who’s ever thought, "Hey, I don’t need a life jacket, I’m on a luxury THING."
