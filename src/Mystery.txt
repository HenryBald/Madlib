Detective FULL NAME stood at the edge of the decaying BUILDING, feeling a strange unease as she approached the site of a long-unsolved case: a woman, FULL NAME, had vanished years ago during a THING party. Inside, the police had set up a station, but NAME couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong. The whispering from within, the fresh THING leading to the cellar, and the heavy air hinted at COLOR secrets still buried in the BUILDING.
In the cellar, NAME uncovered an old chest filled with PLURAL THING addressed to her, each one hinting at forgotten truths. As she read the final THING, a voice echoed in the darkness behind her: "I knew you'd come. The truth has always been waiting for you, Detective." NAME spun around but found nothing. Then, a figure appeared—PLURAL NAME, her face twisted by time. "You don’t remember, do you?" NAME whispered. The truth hit NAME like a shockwave: the BUILDING wasn’t abandoned, and the case had never been solved. This was her past, and it was catching up with her.
